    "imprintDisclaimer":"<strong>Disclaimer moneto</strong><strong>Calculations of leisure time (retirement)</strong><br>1. The following items must be taken into account when calculating leisure time: <br>a. AHV benefits are based on statutory provisions. Missing contribution years are taken into account if entered correctly. Pensions are only shown from the official retirement age (woman 64 / man 65). Early or deferred receipt of pension cannot be simulated. Children's pension entitlement ends in the month of their 18th birthday. For children in education, pensions continue to be paid up to a maximum age of 25.<br>b. Pension Fund1 benefits are displayed from the desired date of the leisure time (retirement). Early or deferred retirement is only displayed if the pensions are entered into the appropriate time periods. Most pension funds provide for the regular start of retirement in the same way as AHV, but can usually start up to 5 years earlier.  Children's pension entitlement ends in the month of their 18th birthday. For children in education, pensions continue to be paid up to a maximum age of 25.<br>c. In Easy Mode, the services of a couple are not displayed together. If both spouses or both persons in a registered partnership receive the AHV pension, they are entitled to 75% of the pensions shown.<br><strong>Calculation of occupational disability</strong><br>2. Full disability is simulated. The analysis differentiates the replacement income in the event of disability on the basis of the causes of illness or accident. Any reductions and ceilings for several pensions in favour of the same person are taken into account. Death benefits are calculated in accordance with the law. Here again ceilings are taken into account. Children's pension entitlement ends in the month of their 18th birthday. For children in education, pensions will continue to be paid up to a maximum of 25. Private pensions cannot be recorded and therefore cannot be displayed. <br><strong>Calculation of survivor protection (in case of death)</strong><br>a. For married couples with common children, the correct pensions are calculated from the AHV and pension fund. For married couples without common children, the correct pensions are likewise calculated from the AHV. Children's pension entitlement ends in the month of their 18th birthday. For children in education, pensions continue to be paid up to a maximum age of 25. Further clarification is necessary in the following situations:<br>b. Married couples without common children may be in a better position for pension payments from pension fund 2 than is provided by law. moneto assumes the statutory minimum benefit (at least five years of marriage and older than 45). <br>c. In calculating the benefits for cohabiting couples under pension fund 3, the law assumes that they have been living together for at least five years and that the partner has provided substantial support. No survivors' pensions are calculated in the programme, as important details are not recorded in Easy Mode. The following possibilities exist:<br>I. Pension fund from the start of joint residence<br>II. The pension fund pays even if no substantial support is provided.<br>III. The pension fund pays if there are common children.<br>IV. The pension fund pays automatically after five years of joint residence.<br>V. The pension fund requires that the benefits to the partner be submitted in writing.<br><strong>Exclusion of liability</strong><br>3. The liability of Virtual Home AG (hereinafter referred to as VH), for anything that could occur in the course of providing services under moneto is excluded to the fullest extent. However, this exclusion of liability does not apply to damages caused by gross negligence or malicious intent on the part of VH."
